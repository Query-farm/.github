# 🚜 Query.Farm

**We build with DuckDB — extensions, products, consulting, and tools.**

## 🦆 DuckDB, Extended

[Query.Farm](https://query.farm) is a product studio focused on extending [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org).  
We write DuckDB extensions, build developer tools, and help teams embed DuckDB into modern data systems.  
If you’re working with DuckDB, we can help you accomplish great things.

## 💼 What We Offer

### 🧩 DuckDB Extension Development  
We build native DuckDB extensions in **C++** and **Rust** — from custom functions and table sources to new file formats and catalogs.  
If DuckDB doesn’t do it yet, we can make it happen.

### 🛠️ Tools & Products  
We’re building software around **DuckDB** and **Apache Arrow**: libraries, connectors, developer utilities, and full-stack integrations.  
Get in touch to learn more or ask about early access.

### 🧠 Expert Consulting  
From performance tuning to production deployment, we help teams use DuckDB effectively — embedded, at the edge, or in the cloud.  
Whether you’re starting fresh or scaling fast, we can guide the way.
